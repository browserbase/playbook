# ðŸ¤˜ Create Browser App

Welcome! This is a starter kit for creating browser apps with [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand).

## Setting the Stage

Stagehand is an SDK for automating browsers. It's built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and provides a higher-level API for better debugging and AI fail-safes.

## Curtain Call

Get ready for a show-stopping development experience.

1. Run `npx create-browser-app` to create a new Stagehand project.

   ```bash
   npx create-browser-app my-browser-app
   ```

   You can also create a project from an example:

   ```bash
   npx create-browser-app my-app --example blank
   ```

   Or to create a project with persistent contexts:

   ```bash
   npx create-browser-app my-app --example persist-context
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd my-app && npm install
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
